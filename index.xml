  Hello everyone, My name is Mahmudul Hasan. This post is the first post on the blog. While after creating this website, I was thinking what can be written as post no. 1, and discovered that: its hard to come up with one good idea. However, I came up with this idea eventually â€” I&amp;rsquo;d like to share how I created this website.</description>

      <description>Hello, welcome to my personal website. My name is Mahmudul Hasan. I am from Dhaka, BD.
In my personal website I will share my thoughts about my vision: ideas I think of, technologies I used or tried, my likes and dislikes about occurence on tech-world. You might agree, or disagree. Like or do not like. I expect you to write it down in comment sections, on DM me on twitter.</description>
